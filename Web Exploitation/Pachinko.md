# Solution

`wget https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_activist_birds/7eac27979c12e4bd449f03e40a8492044221b7d2a96ac85f1150e30983c56eac/server.tar.gz`

To see the source you can use `tar -xvf server.tar.gz` however it's not really needed for this challenge.

You can just spam the submit circuit button until the pop-up gives the flag. If you don't feel like typing it out manually you can see all the POST requests even after closing the pop-up in the Network tab and just copy the flag. Every iteration of submission says success but only occasionally does it give the flag.
